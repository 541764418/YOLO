# YOLO
A pytorch implementation of YOLOv1-v3

# Project still in progress!!!

# To do
[ ] Implement YOLOv1 that includes training and testing.
[x] Implement YOLOv2 that includes training and testing.
[ ] Implement YOLOv3 that includes training and testing.
[x] Data augmentation.
[ ] Using k-means to generate the bounding box.
[ ] Evaluate the model including mAP.
[ ] Data of VOC format -> YOLO format.

# Train

# Test
